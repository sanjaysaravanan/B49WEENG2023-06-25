  while loop: while is used as entry controlled loop
    incremental while
    decremental while

  different ways add elements into an array:
    using index
    built methods
      push ->  Appends new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length of the array.

      pop  -> Removes the last element from an array and returns value of last element. If the array is empty, undefined is returned and the array is not modified.

      splice -> Removes elements from an array and, if necessary, inserts new elements in their place, returning the deleted elements.

      reverse -> Reverses the elements in an array in place. This method mutates the array and returns a reference to the same array.

      sort -> Sorts an array in place. This method mutates the array and returns a reference to the same array.

      slice -> Returns a copy of a section of an array. For both start and end, a negative index can be used to indicate an offset from the end of the array. For example, -2 refers to the second to last element of the array.

  built-in methods to reverse array ---> arr.reverse(); // modifies and reverses the array
  built-in methods to string --> toUpperCase, toLowerCase

  break --> mannual breaking out of a looping statements

  switch case: multiple cases can be checked
    be care full **break** in switch
  
  Recursion: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recursion-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/
    a function calling itself
    
    **if not terminated properly, goes in an infinite recursion**

  Iterating array:
    using index variable
    
  string:
    string --> iteration through chars
